# SpikeRates

MATLAB routines for estimating spike rate functions via state space smoothing.

Algorithmic implementations stem from the following manuscript:

Smith, A.C., Scalon, J.D., Wirth, S., Yanike, M., Suzuki, W.A. and Brown, E.N., 2010. State-space algorithms for estimating spike rate functions. Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience, 2010.

The present implementation seeks to improve numerical stability of the Newton step in Smith et al., 2010, via line search methods.
